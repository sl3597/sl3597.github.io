I am an M.Eng. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell Tech, Cornell University, and currently a **Research Assistant** in the Computer Systems Laboratory, advised by [**Prof. Mohamed Abdelfattah**](https://www.mohsaied.com/)
.

My research lies at the intersection of **Computer Architecture, Machine Learning Systems, and ASIC/SoC Design**, with a focus on building high-performance, resource-efficient systems for LLM inference. I am particularly interested in Hardware Software Co-design across the system stack, ranging from quantization algorithms and kernel optimization to memory-centric system architectures.

Prior to Cornell, I received my B.Eng. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering with First-Class Honors from University College London (UCL). After graduation, I worked as a **Research Assistant** at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [**Prof. Shuwen Deng**](https://www.thu-haslab.org/author/shuwen-deng/), where I conducted research on Compute Express Link (CXL) and memory systems.
